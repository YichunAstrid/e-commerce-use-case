The only complaint is the seemingly longer than normal 'warming' time that the machine takes. I don't remember this happening on other Keurigs. Even with the extra time though, it still beats my old coffee maker when it comes to the amount of time it takes to get my coffee ready before work.<br /><br />Thanks Keurig, for the free pods for this review!|-|-|4|-|-|Kitchen

They do take a little extra practice to learn how to use, so don't try them the first time on a multi batch canning day, load the canner with your 7 jars, and see how they do when you follow the instructions.  The lid has to be secured just right.  I usually apply more pressure to these than I do when I can with the metal jars, but practice makes perfect.  I have found a superior seal with these.  These can be difficult to open, but to me they are well worth it.  I don't have to run to the store to buy more lids, or worry about getting things in advance.  I know how many jars I need for the year, and that is how many lids I have.  Great product.|-|-|5|-|-|Kitchen

I've washed my hands a few times with it on and the color hasn't faded (as of yet) and it doesn't make my had green. However, the prongs aren't really evenly spaced out, which bothers me a little. It's not really noticeable unless you really look at it.<br /><br />UPDATE: It's been a couple weeks now and I've noticed that some of the color has worn off. At least around the band, it's turned like regular gold instead of rose gold. The setting, where the diamond sits is still rose gold so the ring looks two-toned now...|-|-|3|-|-|Jewelry

It is unique.  You get a pack of 3 and they are 1 size small (size 3-5), 1 size medium (size 5-9), and 1 size large (size 7-12).  You can resize your ring in no time.  It does have a little bit of a learning curve to it, but once you get it figured out, it will be your favorite ring sizer.  I love that it has the ring safety feature. You never have to worry about losing your rings. It works with multiple rings and gives you a snug fit.  They are comfortable to wear.  I received these at a discount for my honest review and I must say they are awesome.  I would recommend these to anyone who wears rings.|-|-|5|-|-|Jewelry

The magnets are strong and hold the knives shown in the picture securely. There is a template included for securing the rack to the  wall as well. The only thing I should mention is that it is best to pull a knife down to slide it off of the rack as opposed to pulling it away from the rack, the way it is secured to the wall allows the rack to lift off of the wall a little if you pull away, I'd think over time doing this would wear away the holes that it hangs from.|-|-|5|-|-|Kitchen

I returned them and received a new set. Now I've had them for a couple of weeks and the first time I hand washed them two of them filled up with water that I couldn't get out of the glass. I threw them away and now one other one fills up with what ever you put in them....so buyer beware.|-|-|1|-|-|Kitchen

bf2a6e1f-b854-471f-bf55-922318b87388|-|-|FOUR-C Baking Tools Labyrinth Textured Rolling Pin Fondant Tools Color Transparent|-|-|I am a pastry chef by trade. These special design rolling pins are very handy to add to your design arsenal. It is a quick way to add design flare.<br /><br />What You Get: (1) FOUR-C Rolling Pin &#34;Labyrinth Textured&#34; design, Color: Clear (6.3&#34; inches length X 0.5&#34; inches width x 11.91mm thickness, weight: 0.6 ounces).<br /><br />PROs:<br /><br />➔ This design is an interesting textural design element, it reminds me of the stacks of dumbbell weights, from a profile perspective, joined together.  Could also work for native peoples themed designs as well (see cons). Great for cookies or molding chocolate.<br /><br />➔ Instant Parkay Design. Roll your fondant, or pastry flat, then use this pin to imprint an parkay type textured pattern, wherever you roll it.<br /><br />➔ Modified PMMA (Poly(methyl methacrylate)). An economical alternative to polycarbonate (PC) when extreme strength is not necessary. Additionally, PMMA does not contain the potentially harmful bisphenol-A subunits (BPA) found in polycarbonate. It is often preferred because of its moderate properties, easy handling and processing, and low cost. Non-modified PMMA behaves in a brittle manner when loaded, especially under an impact force, and is more prone to scratching than conventional inorganic glass, but modified PMMA can achieve high scratch and impact resistance.<br /><br />➔ Easy to clean - run under warm water with dish detergent. Hand wash only.<br /><br />CONs:<br /><br />➔ Not heat or dishwasher safe.<br /><br />➔ I would be sensitive to what clients this rolling pin is used for. I just realized looking at it,there is a certain symbol that appears at each of the design joints all over the design, which has very negative connotations to a certain people. Native peoples however,have used this same symbol for millennia as a symbol of peace or prosperity.<br /><br />CONCLUSION:<br /><br />Interesting textural element for random or native people themed parties. Uses are endless, as is your creativity.<br /><br />** I received the FOUR-C Rolling Pin Labyrinth Textured Cupcake Decorating Tools, Color: Clear, Sold by MEIJIA MEILIN, in exchange for providing honest feedback - All views expressed here are of my own and not influenced as a result.ss, as is your creativity.<br /><br />** I received the FOUR-C Rolling Pin Labyrinth Textured Cupcake Decorating Tools, Color: Clear, Sold by MEIJIA MEILIN, in exchange for providing honest feedback - All views expressed here are of my own and not influenced as a result.|-|-|4|-|-|Kitchen

c21b34f1-16c7-4bba-9fa0-619061a791c8|-|-|KitchenAid KSM155GB 5 Qt. Artisan Design Series Stand Mixer|-|-|Christmas gift to myself last year.  Such a beautiful and highly functional kitchen tool. I have the Candy Apple Red and it's a stunner. Great addition to my kitchen arsenal.  I agree with the other reviewers on the cheap look and feel to the utensils.  Disappointing. I bought the mixing utensil with the rubber scraper blades on the edges from Amazon and highly recommend it.  Overall, this mixer blends and mixes most ingredients like a dream. I have not used the mixer heavily and when I do use it I tend to make cookie dough.  I have made pizza dough a couple of times and it's so amazing.<br /><br />The last two times I made cookie dough the motor audibly struggled after I added 2-1/4 cups of flour. I feel like this should not be happening.  Understandable maybe if I was making a double batch.  I'm hoping this isn't the start of a bigger problem. This along with the low quality of the utensils is why this item is rated 4 stars.<br /><br />I also bought the metal mixing bowl and highly recommend the pour shield.|-|-|4|-|-|Kitchen

d8d4ae14-d838-4395-a039-fd2a3b1b5e28|-|-|Keurig 2.0 K350 Brewing System - Black|-|-|This brewer provides many choices as far as cup sizes are concerned. That's a real plus for the selecting the tiny to the large. It also has the carafe that comes in handy when several people are drinking the same flavor. One drawback is that choices of flavors are restricted to cups with the Kuerig  logo. But we have found satisfactory flavored creamers that satisfy different preferences.<br />The reminder to change the filter is a good idea since maintenance is hard for me to keep track of.<br />The choice to brew tea and hot chocolate will probably be used as the weather turns cold and hot beverages are a real necessity.<br />The bottom line is that I really like this model much better than the older one that was used for several years.|-|-|4|-|-|Kitchen
